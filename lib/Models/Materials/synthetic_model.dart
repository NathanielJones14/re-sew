    step1:
        "Cut one back pocket from your jeans for each pillow, leaving as large a border of denim as possible. Square the pocket piece. Cut the legs of your jeans into 6.5 cm strips. You will need up to 180 cm in fabric. Cut two 42 cm x 28 cm pieces for the pillow back fabric of each pillow (you can use old shirts or t-shirts).",
    step2:
        "With the first piece of the pillow back fabric facing wrong side up, fold about ½” (1.5 cm) over at the long edge towards the wrong side. Fold over in half towards the wrong side. Pin in place then topstitch the hem. Repeat for the other pillow back piece. Set aside.",
    step3:
        "Cut a piece of 42.5cm square interior backing (this will not bee seen) and the same in wadding. Lay the wadding onto of the interior lining.",
    step4:
        "Position the pocket in the bottom left of the wadding - lining sandwich. Attach the first strip of denim wrong side up. Pin in place.",
    step5:
        "Using a 3/4 in seam allowance, sew the strip to the pocket, working through all four layers. Finger press the sewn strip so it is right side up. Trim the strip.",
    step6:
        "Attach the next strip to the right of the pocket with the wrong side up. Sew the strip to the pocket, fold and trim as before.",
    step7: "Continue as the diagram dictates, until it measures at least 42cm.",
    step8:
        "Once your front is finished and squared up, position the pillow front with the jeans side up. Place the back of the pillow fabric right side down over pillow front with pieces overlapping. Pin together.",
    step9:
        "Sew around the outer edges on all sides with a ¼” seam allowance. For a snugger fitting pillow cover, use a ½” seam allowance.",
    step10: "Turn inside out and insert your pillow form.",
