    step1:
        "Choose an old pair of jeans that you no longer wear and lay them out. The provided pattern will provide a basic apron but you can always adjust as you go in order to customise your apron.",
    step2:
        "Cut the legs in two down the inseam. This will create flat pieces of fabric with which to cut the body of the apron from. Measure and mark pieces 1 and 2 onto the bottom of the flatten legs. Cut straight across the jean legs to get your first pieces of the apron.",
    step3:
        "Snip away the pocket so that it is clear from the area for pieces 3 and 4. Then cut pieces 3 and 4 from each leg.",
    step4:
        "Pin the two pieces outside facing together. Sew together using a 5mm (1/4in) seam allowance. The ends of the fabric will be thicker and may need a bit of help through the machine with the hand crank on the side. Go slow and be careful. Unfold the pieces, press them out and sew another seam to double hem the pieces for extra strength.",
    step5:
        "Pin a 5mm (1/4in) seam on the two curved areas of your new top part of the apron. Sew a double hem along the length of each curve. Repeat along the top of the piece.",
    step6:
        "Repeat step 5 with pieces 1 and 2 to create the bottom of the apron. Make sure you have the wider edge at the bottom of the piece with a slight angle outwards. Sew a 5mm (1/4in) seam on the bottom of the new piece to complete the section.",
    step7:
        "Pin the top and bottom pieces outside facing together. Sew together using a 5mm (1/4in) seam allowance. Unfold the pieces, press them out and sew another seam to double hem the pieces for extra strength. You should now see the Apron has taken shape.",
    step8:
        "For the neck cut the waist band off the pair of jeans with a heavy pair of scissors. Remove, and set aside, a belt loop for later. Take the button hole and cut it away, about 2 inches in length. Sew the button loop on the left side of the top edge.",
    step9:
        "Sew the waist band pieces together, keeping the button attached on one end. Then sew this to the right side of the top edge of the apron.",
    step10:
        "Cut out the seams from the remainder of the fabric and sew together to make a long length. Sew the belt loop onto the right side of the apron, about halfway up just before the curve. Sew the long length onto the right side. Your apron is complete!",
