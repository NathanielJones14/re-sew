    step1:
        "Cut one back pocket from your jeans for each pillow, leaving as large a border of denim as possible. Square the pocket piece. Cut the legs of your jeans into 6.5 cm strips. You will need up to 180 cm in fabric. Cut two 42 cm x 28 cm pieces for the pillow back fabric of each pillow (you can use old shirts or t-shirts).",
    step2:
        "With the first piece of the pillow back fabric facing wrong side up, fold about ½” (1.5 cm) over at the long edge towards the wrong side. Fold over in half towards the wrong side. Pin in place then topstitch the hem. Repeat for the other pillow back piece. Set aside.",
    step3:
        "Cut a piece of 42.5cm square interior backing (this will not bee seen) and the same in wadding. Lay the wadding onto of the interior lining.",
    step4:
        "Position the pocket in the bottom left of the wadding - lining sandwich. Attach the first strip of denim wrong side up. Pin in place.",
    step5:
        "Using a 3/4 in seam allowance, sew the strip to the pocket, working through all four layers. Finger press the sewn strip so it is right side up. Trim the strip.",
    step6:
        "Attach the next strip to the right of the pocket with the wrong side up. Sew the strip to the pocket, fold and trim as before.",
    step7: "Continue as the diagram dictates, until it measures at least 42cm.",
    step8:
        "Once your front is finished and squared up, position the pillow front with the jeans side up. Place the back of the pillow fabric right side down over pillow front with pieces overlapping. Pin together.",
    step9:
        "Sew around the outer edges on all sides with a ¼” seam allowance. For a snugger fitting pillow cover, use a ½” seam allowance.",
    step10: "Turn inside out and insert your pillow form.",

    step1:
        "The pattern is basically 2 squares and 1 rectangle for the pocket. The measurements were used to create my tote bag. This can be altered to go smaller or larger. You can adjust these measurements based off the jeans you’re upcycling.",
    step2:
        "Cut open at the inside seams (this doesn’t have the cool topstitch the outer seam has). For the pocket piece, add a portion from the top. Try the back upper pockets to give the bag some texture and detail or even a different colour of denim.As long as you make 2 squares you will be good to go as that is all the pattern is.",
    step3:
        "Once you have your pieces, you will measure and mark a 3” square at the bottom corners of both front and back. Cut the squares.",
    step4:
        "For the pocket, fold over the top edge of your pocket ½” press and hem the top edge.",
    step5:
        "Place and pin the pocket onto the front piece, so it’s centered in the middle about 1” in from the corners. Edge stitch down the sides.",
    step6:
        "Pin the cotton webbing starting at the bottom hem and covering the pocket raw edges following that up to the top of edge of the bag and repeat for the other side. Topstitch starting at the bottom outer sides, sewing up across the top edge, and back down to the bottom. Repeat for the other side.",
    step7:
        "Repeat this step for the back. You will want to measure where to place the webbing because you won’t have a pocket to help guide you. Just make sure it’s visually equal to your front piece.",
    step8:
        "Place front and back right sides together sew along the side seams and bottom edge.",
    step9:
        "Because I’m not adding a liner a tip is to add bias tape to sew along the seam allowance. If you have an overlocker, you can clean up the edges this way which is the option I went with.",
    step10:
        "Fold the bottom corners together, so the bottom seam and side seam meet. Pin together, so the seam allowances are going in the same direction. Continue to pin the opening closed. Sew closed with a ¼” seam allowance. Repeat for the other side.",
