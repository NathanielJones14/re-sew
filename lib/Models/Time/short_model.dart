    step1:
        "This washbag uses just two square fabric pieces that are 15” (38cm) x 15” (38cm). Serge the edges of your fabric pieces first, to prevent fraying. You could use an overlock machine for this step, or just use a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine.",
    step2:
        "Place the wrong sides of the fabric together, then lay your zipper on one edge, pin and then sew.",
    step3:
        "Fold the fabric to the other side, and lay the zipper on the other edge again, face-down. Pin and sew once more.",
    step4: "Adjust the piece so that the zipper now lies in the middle.",
    step5:
        "Pull the zipper down halfway, then sew down both sides. Be careful when sewing through the zipper teeth and avoid hitting them with the sewing needle. ",
    step6:
        "Flip the pouch out through the zipper, and this is what your pouch would look like at this point.",
    step7: "Flip the pouch back inside out, and fold the two corners like so.",
    step8:
        "Sew across the corner, with the sewn line being 2.5cm (1' inch) away from the corner. This will create the box-shaped base.",
    step9:
        "Snip off the excess fabric on the corner, then serge the raw edges.",
    step10:
        "Flip the pouch back out again, and you'll end up with a box shape, aka a washbag!",
