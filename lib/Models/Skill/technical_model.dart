    step1:
        "This washbag uses just two square fabric pieces that are 15” (38cm) x 15” (38cm). Serge the edges of your fabric pieces first, to prevent fraying. You could use an overlock machine for this step, or just use a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine.",
    step2:
        "Place the wrong sides of the fabric together, then lay your zipper on one edge, pin and then sew.",
    step3:
        "Fold the fabric to the other side, and lay the zipper on the other edge again, face-down. Pin and sew once more.",
    step4: "Adjust the piece so that the zipper now lies in the middle.",
    step5:
        "Pull the zipper down halfway, then sew down both sides. Be careful when sewing through the zipper teeth and avoid hitting them with the sewing needle. ",
    step6:
        "Flip the pouch out through the zipper, and this is what your pouch would look like at this point.",
    step7: "Flip the pouch back inside out, and fold the two corners like so.",
    step8:
        "Sew across the corner, with the sewn line being 2.5cm (1' inch) away from the corner. This will create the box-shaped base.",
    step9:
        "Snip off the excess fabric on the corner, then serge the raw edges.",
    step10:
        "Flip the pouch back out again, and you'll end up with a box shape, aka a washbag!",

    step1:
        "The pattern is basically 2 squares and 1 rectangle for the pocket. The measurements were used to create my tote bag. This can be altered to go smaller or larger. You can adjust these measurements based off the jeans you’re upcycling.",
    step2:
        "Cut open at the inside seams (this doesn’t have the cool topstitch the outer seam has). For the pocket piece, add a portion from the top. Try the back upper pockets to give the bag some texture and detail or even a different colour of denim.As long as you make 2 squares you will be good to go as that is all the pattern is.",
    step3:
        "Once you have your pieces, you will measure and mark a 3” square at the bottom corners of both front and back. Cut the squares.",
    step4:
        "For the pocket, fold over the top edge of your pocket ½” press and hem the top edge.",
    step5:
        "Place and pin the pocket onto the front piece, so it’s centered in the middle about 1” in from the corners. Edge stitch down the sides.",
    step6:
        "Pin the cotton webbing starting at the bottom hem and covering the pocket raw edges following that up to the top of edge of the bag and repeat for the other side. Topstitch starting at the bottom outer sides, sewing up across the top edge, and back down to the bottom. Repeat for the other side.",
    step7:
        "Repeat this step for the back. You will want to measure where to place the webbing because you won’t have a pocket to help guide you. Just make sure it’s visually equal to your front piece.",
    step8:
        "Place front and back right sides together sew along the side seams and bottom edge.",
    step9:
        "Because I’m not adding a liner a tip is to add bias tape to sew along the seam allowance. If you have an overlocker, you can clean up the edges this way which is the option I went with.",
    step10:
        "Fold the bottom corners together, so the bottom seam and side seam meet. Pin together, so the seam allowances are going in the same direction. Continue to pin the opening closed. Sew closed with a ¼” seam allowance. Repeat for the other side.",
