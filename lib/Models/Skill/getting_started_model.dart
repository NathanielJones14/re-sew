    step1:
        "Grab an old pair of jeans that have worn through or ripped and give them a new lease of life with a traditional Japanese Boro technique.",
    step2: "Cut around the damaged or worn area in a circular or oval shape.",
    step3:
        "Turn the jeans inside out and snip 4 small cuts around the circumference of the hole.",
    step4:
        "Fold the fabric down and sew a small hem to hid the edges of the denim.",
    step5:
        "Find a scrap bit of denim from another project and place behind the new hole. Stitch this roughly in place.",
    step6: "Get your embroidery or sashiko thread and a thick needle.",
    step7:
        "Start a line of straight stitches down the side of the patch you have put in place. Try to keep the stitches even but it is not the end of the world if they are slightly different.",
    step8:
        "Continue the stitching, turning round at the end of the line and coming back up the patch.",
    step9:
        "When you get over the hole you made carry on as normal, trying to stitch the patch onto the original pair of jeans.",
    step10:
        "Continue the stitching until you have a lovely square of stitches. This Boro style of stitching is timeless and gives a new lease of life to worn and damaged jeans. Congratulations on your new pair of jeans!",
